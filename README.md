Electric gocart student project with FRC components

## History

#### 2022-12-23 Idea pitched

On Friday after semester 1 three students from VEX joined in the IDEA center to complete their robot for the 2022-2023 "Spin up" competition. While investigating the limits we discussed the possible reactivation of the FRC program. As a proof of concept we looked to replicate the freshmen project of TAS Taipei American School of building an electric go-cart with two CIM motors from FRC.

Observations so far:
- Aluminum frame 1220x25x50 and 610x25x50 available
- Top would be plywood, supply will be checked
- Powered by two [CIM 12V motors](https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-2000.html) with 250W output
- Electronics with [TALON SRX](https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-8080.html?___store=vexrobotics) over PWM
- Remote control by standard PWM servo system
- Rivet gun and rivets available
- Corner angles could be waterjet cutted
- Some 
- 12T Steel Spur Gear 20 DP available, but further gears?
- Eight [15mm HTD timing belts](https://www.vexrobotics.com/htdbelts15.html) are available
